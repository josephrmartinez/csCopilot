{"prompt":"I picked up your card recently at the Scottsdale farmer's market. If I understood correctly, you do not take wheatgrass to the farmer's market unless someone requests it. I would like to buy fresh-cut wheatgrass. Is it possible to arrange to buy some at the market next Saturday? Also, do you happen to know the best way to freeze fresh wheatgrass juice for later consumption?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You can place an order for wheatgrass here: https:\/\/www.arizonamicrogreens.com\/order As for freezing, I do not have any specific recommendations. If you try to juice and then freeze immediately into ice cube trays, there will likely be foam at the top and sediment that falls to the bottom. Freezing wheatgrass juice in this manner can be cumbersome. There are companies that do flash freezing, but this is done in vacuum-sealed containers with commercial equipment. You will get a shelf life of at least two weeks on the fresh cut wheatgrass. We have not found peer-reviewed research that shows significant difference in the quality of juice from fresh cut grass and grass that has been cut but stored properly prior to juicing. In general, people tell us that they have great results just buying a few bags at a time, storing them in the refrigerator, and juicing the desired amount daily. \n"}
