"Hi! I'll be unable to pick up my order from Uptown Farmers Market this weekend. Can you set my order up for next weekend?
","Sounds good, thanks for the heads up!"
Do you have a price list of the small bags that you sell at the market if you don’t place an order. Thank you for your time.,"We offer all of the small bags for purchase only at the farmers market. They are all priced at $5 each and the availability is subject to change based on seasonality. We are unable to offer these items for pre-order. We typically bring sunflower, pea shoot, broccoli, arugula, and cilantro in small bags to each market. Please let me know if you have any other questions!"
I am looking for a subscription of a tray of wheatgrass once a month. I would love to come by the greenhouse for pick up whenever possible. Please let me know!,"Thanks for reaching out! We sell wheatgrass only in cut bags. This allows us to be totally consistent with the wheatgrass we provide. For greenhouse pickup, we have a minimum of $30. We just don't have any retail infrastructure there and try to operate wholesale as much as possible. For an order of one wheatgrass bag, please use our online order form: https://www.arizonamicrogreens.com/order We will send an order confirmation and have the wheatgrass available for you at the market of your choice."
I live in Sedona- do you ship microgreens overnight or can you? ,"I apologize, we are unable to ship our greens at this time."
Do you have to wash the wellness mix or micro salad before eating?,You do not need to wash at all. The greens are ready to eat as-is. Enjoy!
"I picked up your card recently at the Scottsdale farmer's market. If I understood correctly, you do not take wheatgrass to the farmer's market unless someone requests it. I would like to buy fresh-cut wheatgrass. Is it possible to arrange to buy some at the market next Saturday? Also, do you happen to know the best way to freeze fresh wheatgrass juice for later consumption?","You can place an order for wheatgrass here: https://www.arizonamicrogreens.com/order As for freezing, I do not have any specific recommendations. If you try to juice and then freeze immediately into ice cube trays, there will likely be foam at the top and sediment that falls to the bottom. Freezing wheatgrass juice in this manner can be cumbersome. There are companies that do flash freezing, but this is done in vacuum-sealed containers with commercial equipment. You will get a shelf life of at least two weeks on the fresh cut wheatgrass. We have not found peer-reviewed research that shows significant difference in the quality of juice from fresh cut grass and grass that has been cut but stored properly prior to juicing. In general, people tell us that they have great results just buying a few bags at a time, storing them in the refrigerator, and juicing the desired amount daily. "
Hello - I’m so sorry but I totally forgot we will be out of town next week and don’t need sprouts. Can you cancel our order for tomorrow (Saturday) for the uptown market?,No problem! Thanks for letting us know.

"Hello, I'm reaching out to see if you have any current job openings? Thank you! ","Thanks for reaching out. Currently we do not have any job openings at this time.

Should I wash these greens before eating them?,"No, you do not need to wash the microgreens. "
What is the most nutritious microgreen that you grow?,"Different microgreens have different health attributes. The sunflower is high in protein, the pea shoots are fiber-rich, and the broccoli contains high amounts of sulforaphane. I would suggest ordering a few of our mixes like the Micro Mix, Wellness Mix, and Micro Salad to get the benefits from all of our greens!"
What is in the Micro Salad?,"The Micro Salad contains sunflower tops, petite pea greens, micro radish, and micro cilantro. This is a mild blend with excellent crunchy texture. I'd recommend trying it on sandwiches and as the base of your salad. "
